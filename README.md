Imagine you can prove you are there. It doesn't matter who you are, the fact that you can prove you are now in a place is a value for anyoune that wants anyone to be there.

Generalizing. Proving my path in one ambient can be rewarded

## Examples

  1. If I can prove I went through  a place at a specific time and a client was advertizing its new product at that place at that time I could be rewarded with a discount on purchasing the advertized thing.
  2. If I can prove my car is making a path, I could be asked for an evaluation of the traffic situation and be rewarded with a discount on  fuel by the sorrounding petrol stations.
  3. If I can prove I was in a shop , I could get the right to download a market feedback questionary on the product I bought and receive a discount on the next. 
  4. If I can prove I was in a museum, I could get a customer satisfaction module and get a discount on another museum entry fee to fill it.
  
## Pacman for people.

The system places gifts in the places. Anyone can prove he saw one can get a share of that gifted value.
